              WALK-THROUGH for ULTIMA UNDERWORLD (Ver 1.6)
              --------------------------------------------

                            Mitch Aigner

Yes folks, here it is. It starts with a run through of the highlights of each

GAME OBJECTIVES:
---------------
You have two goals in this game:

1) Survival
2) Find all 8 of the magic Talismans of Sir Cabrius

You cannot finish the game until you have all 8 Talismans, and have re-buried
the bones of the wizard Garamon. In addition, you will need to assemble the
Tripartite key.


General tips:
------------

- Don't kill anyone who is not actively trying to kill you (no matter how rude
  they may be)
- If anyone asks you to run an errand for them, do it (the reward is almost 
  always worth it)
- Trust the good guys (identified by the Banner of Cabrius at their door). They
  will never steer you wrong.
- Save your game often.
- Talk to people more than once. There are different threads to most of the
  conversations. Try different responses each time.
- Write down what people tell you. It may not make any sense now, but could do
  so in the future.


Other useful stuff:
------------------

1. When using Fly or Levitate: pressing "E" makes you go up, pressing "Q" makes
   you go down.
2. You can make a fishing pole with a Pole and Spider Thread (who says there's
   no such thing as a free lunch! Fresh fish are also great for payoffs and for
   bartering).
3. Make popcorn with corn and a torch.
4. You can make a torch by pouring an oil flask onto a piece of wood.

Mantra chants:
-------------

I have included comments on the relative importance of each. NOTE: this is In
My Humble Opinion (which is bound to be different from your opinion, or anyone
elses).

Chant   Skill      IMHO
----- ---------- -----------------------------------
FAL    Acrobat    Need a little to keep from getting hurt in falls/jumps
HUNN   Appraise   worthless
RA     Attack     Need LOTS!
GAR    Axe        Need LOTS only if you are an Axe-man
SOL    Casting    Need a little to keep from getting hurt when spells 'backfire'
UN     Charm      worthless
ANRA   Defense    Need LOTS!
LAHN   Lore       Need LOTS! (to identify scrolls/potions/armor/wands/etc)
KOH    Mace       Need LOTS only if you are a Mace-man
IMU    Mana       Need LOTS!
FAHM   Missile    Need LOTS only if you are a Missiles-man (bow/crossbow/sling)
AAM    Picklock   Real handy on upper levels, not so handy on the lower ones
LON    Repair     worthless, as Shak works cheap (and as fast as you can)
LU     Search     Need a little to help find secret doors
MUL    Sneak      mostly worthless
ONO    Swimming   mostly worthless
AMO    Sword      Need LOTS only if you are a swordsman
ROMM   Traps      beyond worthless
ORA    Unarmed    Need LOTS if you prefer not to carry around a weapon **

** - The game CAN be won without the use of weapons or armor.

Character Creation:
------------------

     Throw away all the characters in the beginning. For each character class
there are a number of random skills assigned each time that you create a new
character,... except that they aren't random!
      Let's say I want to be a fighter. I create a bunch of fighter characters
and throw them all away, but not after writing down each ones' attributes. Now
I quit the game, and re-start the game. I again create a character. The exact
same sequence of characters will appear in the exact same order, but now I know
exactly which one to keep!!
      Strength is the most important skill of all. Most of the rest can be im-
proved later via shrine chants, but not Strength.
      Fighters, Druids, and Tinkers generally have high Strength factors.
      You will want to have a Strength factor of at least 25 in order to wear
plate armor, and still be able to carry a fair amount of goodies. Your carry
capacity (measured in units of "stones") is exactly twice your Strength rating.

The three primary skills (Strength, Intel., Dexterity) are factored in with the
other skill ratings. The final value used by the game seems to be proportional
to the skill level multiplied by the primary skill level tied to it. These
associations are as follows:

Strength:     Attack Defense Unarmed Sword Mace Missile Axe
Intelligence: Mana Casting Lore
Dexterity:    Sneak Swim Search Lockpick Charm Acrobat Traps Repair Appraise

For example: If you are trying to pick a lock, the game uses a number based on
             your Dexterity TIMES your Lockpick skill.

Maximum Vitality and Mana Capacities: These seem to depend on several factors.
             The present theory is as follows:

         Vitality: Depends on Strength and Experience level
             Mana: Depends on Intelligence, Experience, and Mana skill rating

             The precise equations using these numbers remain a mystery.


Fun things to do:
----------------

On Level 4, NW corner (accessible only from level 7), there are two hostile
mages. Kill one, and leave the other alive. Then get out of his way, as he will
throw fireballs at you. Go find some safe corner in which to hide. The remaining
mage will "summon" a wide variety of nasties for you to kill (hostile lizardmen,
mountainmen, fighters, spiders, headlesses, etc), each with its usual assortment
of goodies. This gives you the chance to sample battle with all of the various
denizons of the abyss, as well as cover the floors with loot. Every once in a 
while you may have to go back to the mage and push him around a bit, to keep him
sufficiently pissed off.

Drink lots of Ale and Port all at once - get drunk and pass out! (Just remember
that you need to save at least 1 bottle of Port for rotworm stew.)


Outright spoilers:
-----------------

Level 1 levers puzzle - with 0 being top position, then clockwise: Turn
                        the lever farthest from the door to 1, the next to 2,
                        next one 3, next one 4 (straight down).

Level 2 Goldthirsts' password - "Deco morono"

Level 3 Cup of Wonder - Flute tune is: 3 5 4 2 3 7 8 7 5
                        Mantra for triangulation: "insahn"

Level 4 Maze of Silas - flip the levers in the following order:
                        Silver - Gold - Gold - Silver - Silver - Gold

Level 4 Bullfrog puzzle - The floor area is an 8 by 8 grid of movable tiles.
                          The two levers select the X and Y coordinates of the
                          tile you wish to move. Pushing the upper button on-
                          then-off raises the selected tile. Pushing the lower
                          button on-then-off lowers the selected tile. The wand
                          simply resets the floor to its original state for when
                          you screw up too badly. Build two ramps to get to the
                          two eastern-most corners. Jump through the wall to get
                          into the secret area in the south.
                          
Level 5 Ring of Humility - hit NW lever, then SE, NE, SW. STAY OUT of the center
                           of the room while doing this. Hug the walls.

Level 5 Mine Control Code - with 0 being top position, then clockwise:
                            Left to Right: 7 2 6

Level 5 Garamon - wants you to throw the "talismans" into the "volcano". You 
                  CANNOT complete the game unless you have found his bones on
                  level 8 (Garamon was the brother of Tyball, and one heck of a
                  mage. You will find several runestones (one is "Vas") and a
                  magic ring by the right bones). The bones must be buried in
                  the grave in the tombs on level 5 ("use" the bones on the
                  gravestone). After the ghost appears, you must answer the
                  questions correctly.
                       Another way to tell if you have the right set of bones
                  is to try to stack them on top of another set of bones in
                  your inventory. Like coins, bones will stack,.. leaving one
                  "bones" icon with a number next to it to indicate how many
                  are stacked. Garamon's bones will not stack this way.

Talismans:
---------
Taper of Sacrifice - Level 3, trade with Zak (food)

Sword of Justice -   Level 3, Blade is in secret room. Lever to operate is be-
                     hind a vine-covered wall in the extreme SE corner (Note:
                     you must attempt to "pick up" the vines to reveal the
                     secret door, just "looking" won't work).
                     Level 5, Hilt is in the tombs area, accesible from either
                     the Bullfrog area of Level 4, or a secret door on Level 5.
                     Level 2, Shak will make the repairs for 20 coins.

Cup of Wonder -      Level 3, room where Gazer is (that you have to swim to).
                     Stand on the little pedastal in the corner and play your
                     flute. The flute tune is taught by Eyesnack on level 5. The
                     clues to the three-part mantra (and use of incense) are 
                     taught by Fyrgen and Louvnon on level 6.

Standard of Honor -  Level 4, from Dorna Ironfist, after slaying the Chaos
                     Knight (aka Sir Roderick).

Ring of Humility -   Level 5, room in NW quadrant with levers. Throw levers in
                     following order: NW SE NE SW. Stay away from the center of
                     the room when doing this. After last lever is thrown, ring 
                     will be on the central pedastal. This is told by Derek on
                     level 4 after you give him the Gem-cutter you got from
                     Goldthirst on level 2 after you slew the Gazer in the mine.

Shield of Valor -    Level 6, after defeating the Golem

Wine of Compassion - Level 6, in checkerboard room with 2 headlesses (NW quad-
                     rant of level 6, off room with dozens of worms). Wine is
                     hidden under a floor tile in the SE corner. Try to
                     "pick up" or "use" the tile. Told by dr. Owl on level 6
                     after freeing his servant Murgo from the lizardmen on level
                     3.

Book of Honesty -    Level 6, is in the key behind the hourglass. There is an
                     hour-glass shaped room (NW quadrant of level 6) with a
                     secret door at the end of it. Go through the door and jump
                     across the chasm to get to a key-shaped room. Told by
                     Morlock on level 6 after you deliver the book from Bronus
                     on level 6.

Key of Love -        Level 5, from Judy after giving her the Picture of Tom

Key of Truth -       Level 6, after chanting "fanlo" at a shrine. Found in the
                     title of a book in the Library on Level 6, after talking to
                     Illomo (level 6) after finding Gurstang (level 7) after
                     talking to Illomo the first time.

Key of Courage -     Level 3, NW corner (NW area accessible only from level 7)

Key of Infinity (tri-partite key) - made by assembling the above three pieces.
                                    Just drop them on top of each other in your
                                    inventory, and they will bind.
                        
Lizard Language

bica           - hello, goodbye
'click         - no
'click-iriass  - Sir Cabrius
eppa           - visit
isili          - me (also means I)
kri'kla        - lurker

yethe          - kill
zekka          - food

Assorted Notes:
--------------

There are fountains of healing only on levels 1, 2, and 3

There is one shrine on every level (except level 3 which has three, and level 4
which has two)

Mandolins appear to be completely useless.

Pieces of wood can be used to improvise a torch,.. just douse it with oil.

Spikes are for pinning doors shut. Once a door is spiked, only you can open it.

You cannot defeat Level 7 without making a few trips down to Level 8

You cannot kill the "Slasher of Veils", no matter which side of the moongate
you both happen to be on. (Even with Attack/Defense/and Sword ratings of 250+)
(don't ask). You can get him to the "yellow" state, but not beyond.

When you and the demon are sucked through the moongate, you must run down one of
the three paths (red, green, blue) that go off the central area. That is all you
can do. The Orb you found on Level 1 tells you which path to take.

Maximum skill ratings depend upon the character-type selected (Example: Fighters
can only go to 25 in Mana/Lore/Casting rating, while Druids can go to 30)

Maximum Mana capacity also depends upon the type of character created. Druids 
and Mages rate very high.

Trick to get past all the Fire Elementals in the Chasm of Fire on level 7: When
you come up from the NE part of level 8, you will find a Golem and a Key. There
is a secret door leading to the Chasm of Fire. Open the door and familiarize
yourself with the route from the door to level 8 and the Chasm. Go back down to
level 8 and kill some time while your Mana re-charges. When you are up to about
25 Mana points, fire up two "Sanct Flam" spells and cruise up to level 7 and the
Chasm. The Fire Elementals will cease to be a problem.

Trick to the prison area of level 7: Kill all of the guards ("medallion, I don't
need no steenking medallion!"). The head guard has a key which will open all of
the low-security prison cells,.. and all of the portcullises in the prison area,
... and all of the portcullises in the other guard areas of level 7. Real handy.
The alternative is unpleasant.

There are at least 8 magic rings

There are at least 15 magic wands

Lots of goodies are hidden under bones, debris, etc.  If you see a pile of
debris (of the variety that you can't pick up), look to make sure that every
pixel is in its proper place. If not, carefully click on the offending pixel.

Go swimming in the rivers in the mines of Level 2. Look carefully at any sewer
pipes that you find. (he he he) (don't worry, it's not fatal).

It is generally a bad idea to kill anyone who is not actively trying to kill you
This is for 2 resons: 1) You may have needed to talk to them some more.
                      2) Killing good guys gives you negligible exprience points
                         and in some cases even REDUCES your experience points!
There are more than enough hostile critters around to get you max. experience.

There are a maximum of 16 experience levels. After the 16th level, that's it.

There are a maximum of around 9600 experience points. After that the number will
not increase. (Examples: 9646, 9714, 9688, etc.)

There are 5 secret doors in the tombs of Level 7.

There are 3 secret doors in the Maze of Silas on Level 4.

On levels 3, 4, 5, and 6, there are areas in the extreme NW corner that you
cannot get to other than through the door on level 7. This door cannot be opened
until you have defeated Tyball (i.e. finished all of level 7), and freed the
prisoners in the high-security cells.

Talk to the knights on Level 4 repeatedly. They know lots of mantras you can use
to increase your fighting and weapons skills. They do not neccessarily tell you
these the first time that you talk to them.

Using the Detail setting from the menu can really help if you have a slow 
machine. Cranking the detail down allows much faster/smoother motion. Settings
are as follows: Very High - full detail
                High      - no detail on ceilings
                Medium    - no detail on ceilings or floors
                Low       - no detail on ceilings, floors, or walls
For critical jumps, it is very handy to crank the detail to LOW, make the jump,
and then crank it back up. Especially on slow machines.

To make Rotworm Stew: Get the recipe from the green goblin Lanugo on level 1.
                      Don't lose that recipe!
                      Assemble the correct ingredients in a bowl
                      Then "use" the recipe
                      You will see the icon for the bowl change if succesful
                      There are more bowls/ingredients on lower levels

Moonstone: Once you have the ability to cast a Gate Travel spell (via scroll or
           runestones) fire one up. This will teleport you to the moonstone area
           on Level 2. There is a secret wall to get out of this area. Pick up
           the moonstone and put it down where ever you want. Further Gate
           Travel spells will teleport you to the stone.

Tombs on level 7: You need to get the Crystal Splinter from Kallistan (in the
                  prison cells). Then leave the prison area through the main
                  gate and head south, until you can't go south any more. There
                  is a secret wall (not a door) that will shatter when you run
                  into it. This will not happen unless you have the Crystal
                  Splinter in your possesion, and there is no other way to get
                  into the tombs. There are 5 secret doors in the tombs area.
                  Three of these are located at gravesites that do not have
                  headstones. The other two lead back out into the main areas
                  of level 7. These two are one-way-only secret doors. They can
                  be opened only from the tombs area.

Silver Sapling:
      When you "pick up" the Silver Sapling on level 1, it turns into a seed.
Find some "dirt" floors, and re-plant the seed. The Sapling will re-grow. This
allows you to be re-incarnated if you die. Upon death, you will find yourself
alive once more, at the location of the Sapling. The seed needs to be planted
only once. Re-incarnations seem to be infinite. You can move the Sapling to a
more convenient place by picking it up and re-planting (if you wish).

Rawstag will only open the door if you give him a red gem (any type/condition)

To free the prisoner (Murgo) from the Lizardmen, give Ssetharee lots of food (I
used 10 fresh fish that I caught with my fishing pole).

Give the giant gold nugget to Goldthirst. He will be really impressed.

To raid the Goblin treasuries on Level 1:
   Grey goblins: Throw up a couple of shield spells and just walk in. The guard
will immediately attack, so be quick. DO NOT counter-attack. If you attack any
one of the goblins, the rest will all come running to his aid (and you will be
up against 7 at once). Once you have all of the goodies, leave the goblins'
area. If you return later, only the guard will be upset.
   Green goblins: Don't let anyone see you. Push the guard into the next room
and "spike" the door closed. Then wait until nobody else is looking. Open the
door and close it behind you, as you will be in the treasure room for a while.
Again, if attacked, DO NOT counter attack.

To use incense: Wave a torch or candle over the block of incense. If done right,
the block will change appearance to show that it is lit. Now "use" (left click)
the block, and you will see a vision. Each vision gives you 2 letters of the 6-
letter mantra. Once you have used incense 3 times, you will have all 6 letters.
The pairs must now be re-arranged to get a workable mantra that you can chant
at a shrine (3 pairs of letters, three positions = 6 possible combinations).

There is NO TIME LIMIT to complete the game. You can take as long as you want.

Weapons come in the following calibers: (from worst to best)
Swords - dagger / short sword / long sword / broad sword
Maces  - cudgel / light mace / mace
Axes   - hand axe / axe / battle axe
Missiles - sling / bow / crossbow
Shields - buckler / small shield / wooden shield / tower shield
Armor - leather / mail / plate

Weapons/Armor/etc come in the following grades: (from worst to best)
badly worn / worn / servicable / excellent

off on some weird quest).

Unsolved Mysteries:
------------------

These are things that I just never figured out

Level 3:
There is a lever at the end of a long hallway in the NE qudrant. I never figured
out what it does. (It doesn't have anything to do with the secret door nearby).

Somewhere it is written that there is a secret way to Level 4. I never found it.

Level 4:
There is a pull-chain outside the entrance to the Knights area in the SW 
quadrant that didn't seem to do anything.

There is a Grey Lizardman running around, who claims that his leader is Iss'leek
This is strange, because Iss'leek is the leader of the RED Lizardmen (Ishtass is
the Grey leader). What is this lizardman doing on Level 4, and what do I say to
him?

BUGS
----

Unfortunately, there are several

PROBLEM: Can't talk to anyone below level 1:
         This seems to occur only when someone has the Demo of Underworld, and
         then loads the real game into the same directory. Solution: backup
         your "SAVEx" files, delete everything, re-install, restore "SAVEx"
         files.

PROBLEM: Inventory corruption. There is a patch available to "solve" this
         problem from Orirgin (and available from some FTP sites). It seems
         to help (but not entirely eliminate the problem). There has been 
         some mention that reducing the number of items in a container (pack,
         box, whatever) seems to help. There has also been mention that
         nesting containers (i.e. an item in a box, in a bag, in a pack)
         should be discouraged.

PROBLEM: Game crashes when entering the NW corner areas (accessible only from
         level 7). Solution: try dropping some items. Take only the barest
         essentials. Also, if trapped in this area, you may be able to teleport
         out using a "Gate Travel" spell.

PROBLEM: Screen very dark. There is a file called "shades.dat" in the UW
         directory. Rename it to something else (like "shadez.dat") and
         delete "shades.dat". This should brighten things up a bit. NOTE:
         I have not tried this personally, so I can make no guarantees.
