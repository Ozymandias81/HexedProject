          ===============================================================
          Use Underworld Keyboard Commands as the email subject.

          Finally don't email me questions about anything that isn't
          related to the Keyboard Commands in UW, chances are I can't
          help you!


                                     Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The most recent version of this FAQ can be found at:
    http://www.gamefaqs.com/

 For those of you who lost, or never had, documentation.  The commands here
 are very similar to the first UW, but with a few noticable changes.

 This FAQ looks best in Courier New at about 9 points.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moving around:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       ^           'W' - is running forward
       |           'S' - is walking forward       _
  <-   |   ->      'A' - is turning to the left    |_ Hold SHIFT to turn faster
    \  W  /        'D' - is turning to the right  _|
     A S D         'Z' - will strafe left
  <--Z X C -->     'C' - will strafe right
       |           'X' - is walking backwards (there is no running backwards)
       V           'J' - Jumping (use SHIFT to do a standing long jump)
                   'E' - Elevate (used during levitation)
                   'Q' - Go down (opposite of elevate)


Looking Around: (useful for attacking enemies above or below you)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  '1' - will look up incrementally: the more you press it, the more up you look
  '2' - will look forward (undoing looking up or down)
  '3' - will look down


Attacking:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  F5 - Enters attack mode (and turns it off)
  'p' - attack high (hacking)
  ';' - attack the middle (hacking)
  '.' - attack low (stabbing)


Side Bar:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  F1 - top side bar, brings up the game menu
  F2 to F6 - the rest of the Side Bar from top down
  F7 - switches from the Inventory to the Stats' screens
  F8 - Cast the spell in your spell space
  F9 - Look around for monsters, and will tell you where the monsters are
  F10 - Sleep (if you have a bedroll)


CTRL Keys:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CTRL-Q - Quits the game
  CTRL-R - Restores a game
  CTRL-S - Saves a game
  CTRL-D - Details level
  CTRL-F - Sound On/Off
  CTRL-M - Music On/Off
  ESC cancels any of these


Mouse:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You can move the mouse around with the arrow keys.
                         __
  0 - left mouse button    |__ the ones on the numeric pad
  . - right mouse button __|
  TAB - move cursor to the next "hot spot" to the right
  SHIFT TAB - same but to the left
  ** Note: "hot spots" are the 3 main areas on the screen, the left side panel,
           the main graphic screen, and the character area.


Misc:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ALT-F7 - Version of the game
  ALT-F8 - Tells you your location (first number is Level, then 2 digits for X,
           and 2 for Y, so a 16524 is on level one, x 65, y 24)



This document was created simply because I was unable to find any online
keyboard reference of any kind, and so decided to create my own by trying every
key on the keyboard in the game.  As far as I know, no other such reference
exists.  Also I believe this to be all the keyboard commands in the game, but I
could be wrong.  If you know of any more keyboard commands than are listed here,
please email me at:    dsimpson.faqs@gmail.com

Finally, why wasn't UW released in the Ultima: Collection?
