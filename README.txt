* Hexed Underworld by Ozymandias81 *

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION:

This huge work is a total conversion (graphics from TGA files to PNG) of all the 
piece-of-art things of "ULTIMA UNDERWORLD: THE STYGIAN ABYSS" by (c) Blue Sky 
Productions of 1992, now revamped & reinterpreted by me for Hexen.

Precisely, I've ripped all these TGA files from the abandoned project "UGCK: The 
UW Game Construction Kit" by (c)Kasper Fauerby, an intuitive and well-
constructed editor, in order to create an innovative/ambitious RPG for Hexen that
is inspired to this Ultima's timeless spin-off saga.

Ultima Underworld (and its sequel UW2) can appear like an archeological repert
today, but the story and the playability of these works were stunning in 1992:
it was the first RPG game ever made with a similar-3d world with huge story and
massive quantity of things to do.

You can find the already dead UGCK project at "www.peroxide.dk/UGCK/".
