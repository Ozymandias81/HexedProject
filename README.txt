DESCRIPTION:

This huge work would be a cross-over total conversion between all the piece-of-
art things from "ULTIMA UNDERWORLD: THE STYGIAN ABYSS" and Hexen, using a limit
removing port called GZDoom, which you can get it from here:

http://devbuilds.drdteam.org/gzdoom/

What I already did is ripping out all possible resources from the abandoned
project "UGCK: The UW Game Construction Kit" by (c)Kasper Fauerby, which was imho
an intuitive and well-constructed editor, in order to recreate some sort of an
innovative/ambitious CRPG for Hexen, with a mix of stuff from both games adopting
modern features which comes from GZDoom and GZDoom Builder.

Ultima Underworld (and its sequel UW2) can appear like an archeological repert
today, but the story and the playability of these works were stunning in 1992:
it was the first RPG game ever made with a similar-3d world with huge story and
massive quantity of things to do.

Also someone says that iD Software took inspiration from the concept of the game
itself in order to build the Wolfenstein 3d engine, especially its algorithm for
textures.

You can find the already dead UGCK project at "www.peroxide.dk/UGCK/".
