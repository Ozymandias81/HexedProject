# DESCRIPTION:

This project would be a sort of cross-over TC between all the piece-of-art things
from "ULTIMA UNDERWORLD: THE STYGIAN ABYSS" (mostly) and Hexen, and inspired to
original UW3 plot, RA Salvatore novels and Daggerfall too, using a limit removing
port called GZDoom and its modern features.

It started back in 2014 while ripping all possible resources from the abandoned
project "UGCK: The UW Game Construction Kit" by Kasper Fauerby, which was imho
an intuitive and well-constructed editor, in order to recreate some sort of an
innovative/ambitious CRPG-FPS for Hexen, mixing of stuff from both games and
possibly adding new things.

Ultima Underworld (and its sequel UW2) can appear like an archeological repert
today, but the story and the playability of these works were stunning in 1992:
it was the first RPG game ever made with a similar-3d world with huge story and
massive quantity of things to do.

Also someone says that iD Software took inspiration from the concept of the game
itself in order to build the Wolfenstein 3d engine, especially its algorithm for
textures.
